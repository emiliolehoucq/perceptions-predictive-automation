# Perceptions About Predictive Automation

This repo hosts the data, code, and online appendix for an article I published in the *Journal of Data Science*: [Do Americans Think the Digital Economy is Fair? Using Supervised Learning to Explore Evaluations of Predictive Automation](https://jds-online.org/journal/JDS/article/1282/info).

**Abstract**

Predictive automation is a pervasive and archetypical example of the digital economy. Studying how Americans evaluate predictive automation is important because it affects corporate and state governance. However, we have relevant questions unanswered. We lack comparisons across use cases using a nationally representative sample. We also have yet to determine what are the key predictors of evaluations of predictive automation. This article uses the American Trends Panel’s 2018 wave ($n=4,594$) to study whether American adults think predictive automation is fair across four use cases: helping credit decisions, assisting parole decisions, filtering job applicants based on interview videos, and assessing job candidates based on resumes. Results from lasso regressions trained with 112 predictors reveal that people’s evaluations of predictive automation align with their views about social media, technology, and politics.
